Analysis:

In the Q1 YoY comparison we find that while ridership in Jan and Feb 2020 were north of levels for the same time frame in 2019 there was a month over month decline in ridership and a slight decline in avg trip duration. March 19 was much higher in rider counts vs March 20 however trip duration was higher in March 20. The decline in rider counts was spearheaded by a decline in subscribers, falling from its peak in March 19. Customer rider type actually saw gains for the entirety of  Q1 20, while these numbers are modest and overshadowed by subscribers its worth nothing that every month outperformed the same month for prior year. 	



Men make up the largest share of rider population and drive the age demographics into the 30 - 39 age range followed by the 20 - 29 range. The male population nearly drives all subscriber and rider data. Interesting to note, women and mens density on start/stop locations is different within Manhattan with men having their highest density stops slightly more up town and women slightly more downtown
